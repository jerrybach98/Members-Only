# Members Only!

Rails authentication project using devise and basic associations. Implement authentication systems where users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to. Exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
